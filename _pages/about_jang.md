Anthony received his undergraduate training in neuroscience at Brown University, where he worked with Michael Frank and Matthew Nassar to study how reward prediction errors shape memory. He then completed post-baccalaureate research at the National Institutes of Health with Kareem Zaghloul, using intracranial EEG and microelectrode recordings to investigate the neural basis of memory, attention, and decision-making. He earned his MD through the Harvard–MIT Program in Health Sciences and Technology, where he trained with Jan Drugowitsch developing theory-driven models of human choice and eye-movement behavior. During psychiatry residency in the UCLA Research Track, he worked with Nanthia Suthana, integrating virtual reality, chronically implanted intracranial EEG, and physiological sensing to study fear learning and anxiety in ecologically realistic settings. 

Anthony joined UCLA in Fall 2025 as an Assistant Professor-in-Residence in the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences. His research integrates intracranial electrophysiology, immersive virtual reality, and computational modeling to understand how the human brain learns, makes decisions, and generates emotion in naturalistic settings.
